This folder is the default "MEDIA_ROOT" of the Rotmic development configuration.
That means user-uploaded files will end up within the GIT project (but should
not be checked in) without the need to create external folders. 

For production setup, MEDIA_ROOT should be changed to a system folder served
by the web server.
